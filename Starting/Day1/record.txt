PYTHON

Moving to this language that I have for some reason hated. Idk why. Just happened.
Learning it. Long run it's for AI and Machine Learning.
Short term, challenging myself.
Having different languages doing this similar and the same as well.
Trying to relate the concepts to javascript.

This helps to understand both languages better and appreciate both.(Been learning react and Vuejs as well. A bit of svelte too.)

The arithmetic stuff are just similar. There is a weird division with //. Called a floor division operator.It performs division and then rounds the result down to the nearest whole number (integer). 

Use '+...+'

Takes use input 
	name= input("What is your name?")
	print("Hello '+ name +' !")

Type casting
Used to change data types
 eg str(30) or int(30.5)
 the str converts to string to be used in a sentence   like structure.
Works like stringify in js

LIST
use the [] brackets
they are mutable=> can change values
they can have repeating values
they can have different data types

		Operations
len()
gives length of list



insert(index, value)
adds items to the said index. Index is the position

pop(index)
removes last item if index is not specified

remove(value)
deletes chosen value

del list_name[index]
deletes value at  chosen index
or delete entire list using del list_name

clear()
deletes all items from list
list remains but is empty

append(value)
value added to the end of the list

extend(list or tuple)
adds new list to the end of an existing one

for loop
list = [values]
for x in list:
   print(x)

for loop and range plus len
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])

while loop 
list = [values]
i = 0 
while i < len(list):
  print(list[i])
  i = i + 1

list comprehension
list = [values]
[print (x) for x in list]

newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)
